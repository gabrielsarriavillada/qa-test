### Exercise 1
You can find the test cases written in plain English, following BDD philosophy, in the directory **BDD-test**. I have 
divided them in 2 files: **frontEndTestCases** and **backEndTestCases**.

I have assumed some functionality not specified in the requirements/design, based in common sense and my experience 
in the business.
### Exercise 2
I have created a structure of files with selectors and functions grouped by pages in the folder **src/page-object**, 
creating a POM that can be used to write the tests.

Test cases can be found in **src/spec**. There is one file for login test coverage (**loginSpec.js**), and 
one file for the signup test coverage (**signUpSpec.js**).

Additionally, I have created a few functions that I am re-using during the implementation of the test cases. You can 
find them in the directory **src/utils**.

The result of the last run tests is available in a report generated in **test-report/report.html**. I have used 
`protractor-beautiful-reporter` to do that. This directory (and *node_modules*) has been included in **.gitignore**, so 
it is not available in the repository. It will be automatically generated once tests are run by `protractor conf.js`.

I have added a scenario in **signUpSpec.js** that fails due to a possible bug:
#####Steps To Reproduce
1. Go to registration form
2. Fill all the fields with valid data in step 1
3. Go to step 2
4. Fill all the fields with valid data, and ensure that phone number has been used before to register an account
5. Submit registration
6. Replace phone number by a phone number that has not been used before
7. Submit registration
8. Confirm registration
#####Expected Results
5. Notification should appear with error in registration
8. Notification should disappear after confirming correct registration
#####Actual Results
5. Notification appears with error in registration (correct)
8. Notification is still displayed after confirming correct registration (wrong)

You can find a sample report in **test-report-sample** with one of the reports generated by these tests.
