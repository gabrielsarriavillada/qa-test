Story: Rewards backend

As a user
In order to have a record of my rewards
I want to have a Json with my rewards and all their details.

Scenario 1: Only "userName" parameter could be passed in method to get reward history
Given the method '/igc/betspin/rewards/history'
Then 'userName' is accepted as parameter in the method
And no other parameter is accepted in the method

Scenario 2: A Json of unique tokens should be returned for certain user
Given the method '/igc/betspin/rewards/history'
And an user with some claimed unique tokens
When the method is used with username as parameter
Then a Json object is returned for the user
And the Json is an array of unique tokens

Scenario 3: Correct unique tokens should be part of the Json
Given an user with some claimed unique tokens
When a Json is returned for the user
Then all unique token in the array have been claimed by the user
And all the unique tokens claimed by the user are part of the array

Scenario 4: Unique tokens should be sub-arrays objects
Given an user with some unique tokens
When a Json object is returned for the user
Then every unique token in the Json is a sub-array object

Scenario 4: Unique tokens claimed more than once should be part of a sub-array
Given an user with some unique tokens
And one of the unique tokens has been claimed twice
When a Json object is returned for the user
Then the unique token claimed twice is available in the Json as sub-array objects

Scenario Outline 5: Sub-array objects should contain correct information about unique tokens
Given an user with some unique tokens
When a Json object is returned for the user
Then every unique token contains '<information>'
Examples:
| information  |
| game-slug    |
| date claimed |
| info         |
| reason       |
| expiry date  |

Scenario 6: Unique tokens are available on chronological order in the Json
Given an user with some unique tokens
When a Json object is returned for the user
Then array elements are returned in chronological order
And subarray elements are returned in chronological order
